# Library-App
This is my Final Project for QA


    Why are we doing this?
    - We are doing this final project, in order to solidify what we have learned over the duration of the course.
    I have decided to create a Library app that works with a database to store books and their details.
    
    How I expected the challenge to go.
    - I expect the challenge to go well and all major aspects of the app being covered such as CRUD dependencies.
    
    
    What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
    Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
    Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.
    Screenshots of your database to prove that data is being persisted.
    Screenshot of your test results, including coverage report.
    Link to Jira Board - You must add your trainer(s) as collaborators also.

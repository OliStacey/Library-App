# Library-App
This is my Final Project for QA


    Why are we doing this?
    - We are doing this final project, in order to solidify what we have learned over the duration of the course.
    I have decided to create a Library app that works with a database to store books and their details.
    
    How I expected the challenge to go.
    - I expect the challenge to go well and all major aspects of the app being covered such as CRUD dependencies.
    
    
    What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
    - I created a basic API for my Library which is able to handle CRUD functions.
    - Integrations tests could be created in order to reach coverage.
    
    Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
    - A function that contain multiple copes of the same book.
    Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.
